    <article class="content">
      <p>Sweat dripping and the hum of the fluorescents made for a soothing combination of sounds, but I was focusing on something else. Two immigration officers were in the next room discussing my passport, or perhaps it was my sister’s? I listened, but I could not understand.</p>
<p>I sat in a dank room, walls grim, worn carpet, and cheap chairs. Federal offices all over the world must order from the same catalog. Another gentlemen from an undisclosed country waited with me. I sat wiping sweat off my brow, he paced. Was this a nightmare? Fevered hallucinations? No, this was my attempted escape from the Johannesburg airport.</p>
<p>Yes, I had flu but was I really that compromised? Scenarios ran through my head. It was useless. My exit out of South Africa sat in the hands of the portly officer.</p>
<hr />
<p>Fourteen days prior I blissfully boarded my plane from Frankfurt to Johannesburg. I was heading to Africa for the first time. My mind full of anticipation, wonder, and excitement.</p>
<p>Ten hours later I am preparing for my way through immigration, someone will scan my passport.</p>
<p>You see, my passport has two odd features I discovered right before my trip. First, my picture is from when I was fifteen. I have long hair. Oh, and I could easily be mistaken for a girl. Look closely and you may recognize me. But there’s something else…</p>
<p class="emp">The gender on my passport says female. I’m unmistakably male.</p>

<h3>Sneaking into South Africa</h3>
<p>The line for entering South Africa is long and painful. After two ten hour sleepless flights I am exhausted. Rather than try to explain my gender situation I decide to feign ignorance. Two passport checks in Germany were no problem.</p>
<p>I hand the immigration officer my passport and I wait, nervously. First she questions the picture. I try to explain, I’ve changed, I was young then, fifteen. She looks at gender inquisitively. She asks, and what is your gender?</p>
<p>I’m male, of course. Unfortunately, my passport does not say male. The officer asks, “Why do you have your sister’s passport?” I act confused. She kindly points out the error and I am aghast.</p>
<p>I’ve never been good at acting. She directs me to sit in the corner, dunce cap on while waiting for the supervisor, clocks tick.</p>
<p>My passport makes rounds. The supervisor asks fellow officers if the person in the picture is male or female. They ask me why I have my sisters passport. My confidence is shaky. I am not sure if I will ever touch the soil of South africa.</p>
<p>I present my drivers license, I feel a hint of encouragement. I explain that I am here for work and am presenting the next day. After more discussion and a scolding for having a ten year old passport that incorrectly identifies me as a girl, they reluctantly let me in, phew.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Judgement Day</h3>
<p>My journey home is filled with anxiety. I worry again about my passport, whether I will be able to get home. I know they have stricter immigration checks than most other countries. I never imagined what was ahead for me.</p>
<p>I leave Cape Town with a sore throat, a runny nose, and a slight fever. I arrive in Johannesburg with a terrible fever and stomach ache, barely able to utter a word. With a few hours before my connection I must find medicine.</p>
<p>Luckily the first store after getting off the plane was a full-fledged pharmacy. After trying to navigate the mostly-Afrikaans labeled medicine I get in line for the pharmacist. The gentleman in front of me explains his daughters symptoms, they are exactly what I am feeling. I buy the same medicine and walk out with relief.</p>
<p>After visiting the restroom and taking my medicine I start making my way to my gate. I begin sweating as I schlepp my bags through the airport. As I get closer and closer I realized I have to go through security again.</p>
<p>I’m confident, South African airport security seems relaxed. I prepare my bags, chug my water, and get in line. As I get closer I see another line after security, passport control.</p>
<p>I hoped the passport control was casual, similar to Germany. They scrutinize your passport getting into a country, I never imagined it would be hard to get out of a country.</p>
<p>As I joined the queue I realized this could be the beginning of my nightmare. And it came earlier than expected. The line crawls. And it wasn’t for a lack of people checking passports.</p>
<p>While waiting in line I survey the immigration officers. I tried to find a reasonable one. I rule out one, he looks terrifying.</p>
<p>I drew him, of course! I presented my passport, damp with perspiration. His eyes set on the passport then he looks up at me. And again. And again. UP, down, up , down.Then comes the question I never expected.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“This is not your passport. Where is your passport?”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m dead silent. I nervously point out that my picture is old and I am a male even though it says female. I try to explain that it is mine. He quickly calls someone else over and says something I don’t understand. I am pulled aside and he tells me to go with him. Oh no.</p>
<p>Weighted with luggage and sweat I struggle to keep up with my leader. We wander through the terminal, seemingly endless, before exiting through a side door. After an enduring set of stairs, locked doors with fingerprint security, and several long poorly lit hallways we end up in the requisite federal waiting room. My passport and ticket are ripped from my hands.</p>
<p>I’m drenched. The passport draws a furious discussion between officers as they study the picture. One officer pokes her head in to get a closer look. The other sketchy-passport refugee joins me and begins pacing. Finally, I am summed to the supervisors office.</p>
<p>I am grilled on the details of my passport: why did you not correct your passport, what are you doing in South Africa, where are you going? I try to explain my situation. I present my license and offer my full wallet for evidence. He stays quiet but keeps shaking his head.</p>
<p>He’s holding my ticket. I have ten minutes until boarding closes. After some hesitation he calls in his colleague to escort me back to the original passport control. I breath a silent sigh of relief, hoping this means freedom.</p>
<p>Once we start moving the officer asks me which line I came from. We are in the caverns of this airport. So many stairs, and hallways, passing doors, and I have a terrible fever. I am lost. I declare my utter state of delirium.</p>
<p>We are back in the main terminal. He asks again “Don’t you remember what line you were in?” Finally, I get my bearings and we make our way back.</p>
<p>As we approach the officer who originally sent me away, my nerves return. I go through the same process showing him my license, explaining my situation, and perspiring. It’s clear he does not want to let me through but knows his supervisor approved it. He writes down all of my information, looks at my ticket and tells me to run, fast!</p>
<p>I give a quick thanks and start running. Running away. Running toward freedom, at least temporary freedom. All I want to do is sit, have some water, and sleep.</p>
<p>I’m running for what seems like miles. I break and realize I am departing from the furthest gate. I keep running and running, catching my breath, resting on the electric sidewalk , and then my last sprint to the end.</p>
<p>I see the gate, the door is still open. I made it. Coughing and winded but with a lighter heart I hand my boarding ticket and passport to the gate attendant. And then the question comes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Are you sure this is you?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trying to stay composed I tell her I have changed a lot in the last ten year. She laughs and tells me I have really grown into a man and motions me onto the plane. I made it. I made it. I made it.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Home Sweet Home</h3>
<p>During the plane ride I pass through three mental states: sleep, feverous delusion, and distress about getting through Germany and into the US.</p>
<p>I find luck in Germany by missing any of the passport control stations. I enjoy my connection there like no other flight connection I have ever had. I feel like the king of the world, free to move about Terminal 1-Z doing whatever I please.</p>
<p><img alt="The huge airbus A380" src="https://d233eq3e3p3cv0.cloudfront.net/max/2560/0*yz0zMb9xzx6bQlI4.jpeg" /> My tranquil state carries over for most of the flight to the US. I get to fly one of the double-decker Airbus planes for the first time. I enjoy my last moments of freedom. We are handed the US customs forms and the hammer of reality drops.</p>
<p>Once again, in the passport line and my mind is racing. What do I say? How do I tell them it is really me?</p>
<p class="emp">I decide to be my true self and explain my situation honestly.</p>

<p>I approach the US immigration officer,no expectations. I hand him my passport, explaining my situation. There is an error on my passport. I found out about it right before my trip, I did not have time to change it. The picture is from many years ago. I had long hair, and yes, And don’t worry, I submitted the application for an error correction today. I have a drivers license if that helps. I am not sure what to do, I barely got out of South Africa.</p>
<p>He stays silent. He looks at me, looks at my passport, scans the passport, and examines my drivers license. And finally he speaks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Are you sure you didn’t get a gender change operation on the plane?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Deep, uncontrollable laughter releases days worth of tension, I tell him no, I have always been a male. Contrary to all expectations he explains how I can get my passport fixed and that I can probably get a new longer expiration time out of it for free. Then he stamps my customs document and sends me on my way. The relief is palatable.</p>
<p>The rest of the journey home has its hiccups but I know I can get there. It may be painful, full of delays, bloody noses, and dehydration, but I can make it without worrying about my passport.</p>
<hr />
<p>And don’t worry, I submitted the application for an error correction today. No longer will I be flying as my sister. Or a female fifteen year-old male. Or anyone but myself. Because in the end being true to who I am is the best way out of a very sticky situation.</p>
