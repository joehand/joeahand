      <p><strong><em>Welcome to the most definitive guide ever about the happiest place on Earth. Inside I offer a simple three step fix to finally reach the ultimate goal in life.</em></strong></p>
<p>After reading through top ten list after top ten list, a book about the happiest countries on Earth, surveys about happiness, and even visiting some happy places, I finally found it, <strong>the happiest place in the World</strong>.</p>
<p>Searching Google for <strong><em>happiest place in world</em></strong> yields almost three million results. Millions of top ten lists fight to reach the top ten spots on the first search page. A self-proclaimed grump, Eric Weiner, even took it upon himself to fly around the world searching for the world's happiest place in the book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/044669889X/ref=as*li*qf*sp*asin*tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=smijoe-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=044669889X">The Geography of Bliss</a></a></em>.</p>
<p>Nine different countries and one happy US city later he concludes the destination of happiness can be reached through many paths: &gt;Money matters, but less than we think and not in the way that we think. Family is important. So are friends. Envy is toxic. So is excessive thinking. Beaches are optional. Trust is not. Neither is gratitude.</p>
<p>With so many different ways to happiness how can you know what path is right for you? Perhaps it is not about the journey but the people you meet along the way. The author reconsiders one of the people he met on his journey and decides "happiness is completely and utterly intertwined with other people... happiness is not a noun or verb. It's a conjunction. Connective tissue." So it must be more about the people than the actual place. Now we are left to wonder how to find these relationships that make us happy.</p>
<p>Even after trotting the globe trying to discover happiness he ends his journey "not 100 percent happy. Closer to feevty-feevty." Unfortunately, no one informed him of the true, happiest place on earth. You cannot find it on any of the top ten lists on Google. And no, it is not Disney World.</p>
<h3>The Way to Happiness</h3>
<p>I offer you a simple three step process for the way to happiness:</p>
<ol>
<li>Buy a plane ticket to Denmark. 2.   Pack your stuff, fly there. 3.  Arrive in world's happiest place, be happy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Foolproof right? Year after year Denmark ranks as the "<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7487143.stm">world's happiest nation</a>." So anyone who goes there must be happy. It's the rules.</p>
<p>However, you cannot suddenly become happy by just arriving in Denmark and any fool knows this. <strong>To find true happiness, it must come from within</strong>. Sure you can enjoy a beautiful place, wonderful food, or a great concert. But unless you have the right attitude, nothing external will make you happy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no way to happiness. Happiness is the way. &gt;&gt;<strong>Thich Nhat Hanh</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Cultivating Happiness</h3>
<p>I talked briefly at the end of my last post about planting the seed for this attitude. First you must be aware of what you can and cannot control. Things happen. Great things, terrible things. Unless you are a wizard or have a time machine you are powerless to change the past. But you still have a great power within you.</p>
<p>You have the power to control your thoughts. Every event summons a reaction within your mind. Start to nurture the attitude that you have the superpower of authority over your mind. Be attentive to your immediate response to any external event. Here is your homework assignment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acknowledge your knee-jerk thoughts, becoming aware of them as they develop. *  Remember that you have a superpower. With that power you can control your mind. *   Finally, let the thoughts pass by, as if they were a small cloud in an otherwise blue sky.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Keep the Sky Blue</h5>
<p><em>Cultivate a blue sky in your mind</em>. Actively strive to keep that sky clear of nasty thoughts and intentions-- <strong><em>for that is the only place in the world where you can find happiness</em></strong>. See the clouds, say hello if you like, then watch as they drift out of sight.</p>
<h4>Find Your Smile, Find Happiness</h4>
<p>On the author's final leg of his journey, he recounts a serendipitous meeting with the airport bartender. The bartender's name, of course, "Happy." Without hesitation the author asks him what the secret of happiness is. His answer, simple: &gt;"Just keep on smiling. Even when you're sad. Keep on smiling."</p>
