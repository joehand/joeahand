    <article class="content">
      <p>I have been struggling to start. When I do start, I lack the patience to finish. This blog for example: I excitedly created the site, wrote the first post, and then waited, but nothing happened. For some reason the blog did not blossom like I had imagined.</p>
<p>Ben Franklin knew how to start his writing career. At thirteen, Franklin started by rewriting other's work. He never stopped. Shortly after he was submitting letters to the local paper under a fake name. Throughout his life he pushed new ideas forward. Ben Franklin initiated, just look at the list: successful printing shop, library, volunteer firehouses, safer fireplaces, bifocals, electricity. By poking the box, he became one of the most influential people of his era.</p>
<h4>Poke the box</h4>
<p>In his book, Seth Godin stresses starting and shipping - a blog post, a worldwide revolution, or helping a stranger unprompted - ship something new however large or small. The default, the safe thing to do is nothing. If you create enough then you will fail. Leading the reader by the hand and acknowledging all bad that may come, the book forces the reader take action. Without failing there cannot be success.</p>
<p>Throughout reading the idea of creative destruction was in my mind. Joseph Schumpeter proposed entrepreneurs drove the growth of the economy through creative destruction. Entrepreneurs are driven to markets where monopolies are coasting on old technological innovation. All of the new entrants attempt to create a more efficient technology. One successful innovation topples the old monopoly while creating a new one. The growth of the economy depends on the number and success rate of the entrepreneurs. With barriers to innovation at a low, this idea is more powerful than ever.</p>
<h3>Creative Destruction of the self</h3>
<p>Creative destruction has always described the economy, but what about a person? When I lift weights- that is creative destruction- I am destroying my muscle fibers to encourage them to grow back stronger. This is what Seth proposes.</p>
<h4>Create a new you: start</h4>
<p>This week I made the goal of doing getting 100% injury free. Using my awesome book, <em>The Complete Book of <strong>Pilates for Men</strong></em>, I planned my first mini-goal. I scoped out the <em>advanced reformer on the mat workout</em> and set it in my sights. About half the exercises looked impossible, but not quite.</p>
<h5>Start small</h5>
<p>I started with a simple 20 minute workout every morning, the <em>beginner mat workout</em>. A huge red X went on my calendar after each completed workout, the Jerry Seinfeld method. One week later I feel a bit stronger. But I really need to push the box.</p>
<h4>Deliver on that new you: ship</h4>
<p>Creating a plan and starting is good. The real goodness comes from shipping. In one month my calendar may be full of red- what then? Well, I will have a stronger core, maybe I will love Pilates or hate it. Cool, that does not sound so bad. In one year my calendar may be full of red- what then? My body will be stronger than ever. Even a third of the way through the book, my body moving in a way that was once impossible. Down the road, when I am 80, I may even be doing the stuff Joseph Pilates did.</p>
<h4>Failure or success is irrelevant if you progress</h4>
<p>In committing to do Pilates for thirty days I know I will push the box. So what if the Pilates space in my box never expands again. It has been pushed, it was not worth it, my box expanded and I moved to push elsewhere- maybe yoga. Then the process starts all over again. Always moving outwards.</p>
<p>I imagine myself testing to optimize my personal self. The goal of my life is to expand. Right now, I need to find where there are maximum returns, just as the entrepreneurs do in the creative destruction economy.</p>
<p>The markets where monopolies sit tantalize entrepreneurs. If they succeed in overthrowing the monopoly the rewards are great. They become the new monopoly. Markets where profits are small or levels of technology superior provide no motivation.</p>
<h5>Where is your personal monopoly?</h5>
<p>Part of you is stuck in routine. It refuses to change. You act the same way in certain situations, always acknowledge people in the same manner, or pick the same thing every time. Just once try act differently, see how it feels, let it soak in. Rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>In the economy one entrepreneur succeeds because so many others fail. If it was one entrepreneur vs one monopoly, I'd put my money on the monopoly. One million entrepreneurs and it is a different story. That is why the value comes from poking the box again and again not doing it once.</p>
<h3>Everyone poke together now</h3>
<p>It is scary to think about a world where every person is as determined as Ben Franklin was. Scary because of the amount of astonishing things that could be done. While each person has their own box to push, it is not all that gets pushed.</p>
<h4>One box growing encourages another</h4>
<p>One day someone in the neighborhood decides to push; she smile and says hello to everyone passing- a stranger smiles back. She watches his box expand as he walks away. A smile is one thing, but Ben Franklin reached for much more than just kindness towards strangers. At first he pushed to expand his own box, then that of the local paper, he did not stop until he made a huge dent in all of mankind.</p>
<p>With each small poke the boxes that enclose us grow; first the box of your house, then your neighborhood, and if you poke hard enough eventually you will push the box of all humanity further.</p>
