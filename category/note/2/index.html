                        <div class="entry-content"> <p>Washing away the old and preparing for the new. Before on this page there were a couple blog posts, but nothing worth talking about. Seth Godin <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths*blog/2011/07/put-your-name-on-it-1.html">posted today</a> about <em>putting your name on it</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If you can't sign it, don't ship it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The things I wrote before were not worth signing. This decreased my motivation to write new posts. So here is to starting fresh--creating something where I will proudly display my seal of approval.</p>
<h3>Riding the wave.</h3>
<p>This fresh start comes on the wave of another new project. Two weeks ago I began a project at <a href="http://smilingjoe.com">SmilingJoe.com</a> called <strong>Experiments in Kindness</strong>. I feel a strange force pulling me forwards. Bringing me towards new opportunities, encouraging me to explore new ways of thinking. It is exciting yet scary. I only hope I can stay above the surf.</p>
<p>But getting knocked down may be a better experience than riding the wave itself. So then I look forwards to whatever lies ahead.</p>

                        <div class="entry-content"> <p>I feel like the biggest driving issue with digital books is the container. Once the container gets standardized, the content and usage can become more standardized. So I guess the question is how to you become the standard container for a type of information. I would imagine the book had some sort of competition, people who bound the pages in a different way or presented ideas differently, right? It does not really sound right.</p>
<p>I wonder if we are too stuck on the idea of a <em>book</em>. Does a remix machine need even to have that idea. There is definitely some idea of cognitive location within an argument. Without knowing how long the argument lasts it may be difficult to focus or understand what the writer is saying. But how can we say that when have books that range from 50 pages to thousands. We have messages that are limited to 140 characters and messages that are unlimited.</p>
<p>When information first started to be communicated over wires a new neo-language had to be invented to convey the message. Then in order to protect privacy and save money people went further to create secret languages on top of this neo-language. That is a pretty powerful idea.</p>
<p>Just by having this standard means of communication people were able to be so innovative around it. Was it the standardization or the uniqueness or what? It seems like the morse-code telegraph broke so many boundaries it had to be a hot bed ripe for innovation. So how do you create that kind of atmosphere around a product.</p>
<p>Does it tell a story? Or connect people? Or just provide economic advantage?</p>
<p>Maybe our thinking is indeed too narrow. Is the portal or the container more important. I think of Google as a portal. iTunes is more of a container. Both are powerful market movers.</p>
<p>Google has used the portal to become a container for other types of goods. What gave them an advantage here?</p> </div><!-- entry-content -->

                    <article class="content">
                        <div class="entry-content"> <p>Both Ken Robinson and Seth Godin preach similar sentiments. Each encourages us to start doing something we love and share that gift with others. By doing something we love we become more energized by doing that thing. That allows us to share even more with the world. At the same time, when we do something we love, the opportunities change in our lives. By living through our passion we can reshape our lives to become something better.</p>
<p>'Be the change you want to see in the world' -Ghandi</p>
<p>Just like an angry person cannot bring world peace, you must follow your passion to live a fulfilling life. The difficulty comes in finding what that passion is.</p>
<p>Where have I found myself to be passionate? When have I done something where I lose all track of time? What activities give me energy?</p>
<p>These are all very interesting questions that are difficult to answer. I can think back about what I have done in the past that fueled me, but what if that has changed. I can think about what I am excited about in the future, but is that enough to drive my life forwards.</p>
<p>I am passionate about happiness in a way that others do not seem to be. I am passionate about being myself, caring, kindness. I strive to be the best person I can be, and I enjoy spending time understanding how I can do that.</p>
<p>I love new ideas. I love seeing new ideas change others even more. But how can that help me find my tribe?</p>
<p>Maybe I should have been an engineer or architect. What if that is what I was meant to do? How would my life path look different had I pursued that passion?</p>
<p>I want to write more today. Yesterday I proposed a post about the overarching goal of Seamless. Perhaps that is too grand of a topic. I am distracted. The resistance is pulling me away. Should I give in? Should I keep writing?</p>
<p>Maybe my passion is just as the quote from Ghandi above. Perhaps I can find my passion by being the change I want to see in the world.</p> </div><!-- entry-content -->
