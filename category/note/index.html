                        <div class="entry-content"> <p>There are countless blog posts about how to save for retirement. <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/">In this post</a> Mr. Money Mustache presents an amazingly simple and shockingly effective way to look at retirement; the amount of time until you can retire is simple a function of your savings rate. What doesn't matter? Your income, your spending, your age, or anything else.</p>
<p>Not only is the equation simple, the idea behind it is very powerful. Looking at the table he presents, you can see that by increasing your savings from 10% to 15% you can chop 8 years off your time until retirement. Wow!</p>
<p>The reason this works? In order to increase your savings rate, you probably have to decrease your spending. This means that you will be able to live off less for the rest of your life. And your money saved will be compounded over time. So, there are some strict assumptions in there. But the idea behind everything is very intriguing, and I suggest you at least <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/">take a look</a>.</p>
<p>I just discovered the Mr. Money Mustache site but already it has become an invaluable resource on financial advice for me. It bucks much of the conventional wisdom and focuses on spending less through decreased consumption, an idea that is close to my heart. Not only does it leads to more happiness, it helps our planet as well. <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/02/22/getting-rich-from-zero-to-hero-in-one-blog-post/">Read away</a>!</p> </div><!-- entry-content -->

                        <div class="entry-content"> <p>The Reed College experience is often hard to capture. The latest Reed Magazine has a great history of the Reed experience and how it came to be. At Reed you "think about thinking" and learn reasoning by doing. During the process you realize “you are not your ideas, but merely a holder of your ideas.” But this all relies on a open process that does not define a starting and ending point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If, on some level, we know what the learning system wants from us—say, by the use of grades as feedback on a defined path toward earning a degree to enter a specific career—we can erect certain internal defenses that allow us to choose how much of ourselves we give away to the system. But when the contract with the system is as existential as learning for the sake of learning, and progress is measured more qualitatively than quantitatively, we are apt to lose some of our psychic protections, allowing the system to get more deeply into our heads."</p>

<p>I joined some friends for a beautiful picnic last night in Portland's Rose Garden. Great friends, great food, nice weather, flowers, and some good wine. Not much more you need for a good birthday celebration.</p>
<p>I have thought a lot about living a long life. I hope this quarter century marks the first of six in my life. 150 seems like a long life. But I will be sure to enjoy every day of it.</p>
<p>Happy first day of summer!</p>

<p>Also - just for the record - biking home with a bunch of balloons tied to your back is pretty fun. I would recommend it.</p> </div><!-- entry-content -->

                        <div class="entry-content"> <p>Creating a habit in a tricky thing. At first it seems so simple. You wake up and floss your teeth. Boom, done. Next day - you almost forget but then remember, teeth flossed. Then the third day you may forget or put it off until the day it done. And eventually you keep putting it off and it does not get done.</p>
<p>Starting a new habit is not something you can just jump into. You must slowly approach it so as to not scare it off. Then you need to coddle it, never let it leave your side for a month. After a month it starts to grow. But it can still escape if you are not careful. Every week you must reconnect with it. Remind yourself why you are building this habit and what you hope to achieve. After a couple months your habit may finally blossom.</p>
<p>There is a science to habits, literally. There are millions or even billions of dollars in creatings habits. Companies try to get you in the habit of buying their product. Grocery stores get you in the habit of buying a treat, just this one time, in the checkout line. If you approach habits with the same careful scientific mindset, you can get in the habit of creating habits.</p> </div><!-- entry-content -->

                    <article class="content">
                        <div class="entry-content"> <p>On June 29th 2011, one week and one day after turning 24, I set out on a mission. The mission: make some yummy chocolate chip cookies. Something about making chocolate chip cookies always strikes the right notes with me. When I bake my soul is at ease. Me and the cookies are one. I am not sure what it is; part science, part chocolate, lots of sugar, and of course, smiles. People love cookies and I love making people smile.</p>
<p>After I had lots of cookies, I needed someone to eat them. Deciding to give them to cyclists heading home from work was the easy part. The real inspiration struck me while reading about the ongoing conflict in Ladd's Circle. And so my first Experiment in Kindness was born.</p>
<p>The response of the complete strangers receiving cookies amazed me. I cannot remember a better bike ride than the one returning home after that experience. It did not take long for me to launch <a href="http://smilingjoe.com">smilingjoe.com</a> and make it a goal to keep my experiments going.</p>
<p>Kindness begets kindness. We can each make the world a better place with kindnesses small or large. Even if my experiments fail or stop completely, I know that for that one day, in those 30 minutes, I put smiles on 100 faces and that is enough.</p>

<p>The day always looks brighter from behind a smile.</p>
