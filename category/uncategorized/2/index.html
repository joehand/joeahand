                    <article class="content">
                        <div class="entry-content"> <h3>Enjoying the Music</h3>
<p>I listen to music a lot. While I am not a huge music buff, I like to have stuff playing while I work, cook, clean, or just hang around my house.</p>
<p>Music becoming digital has led to a near infinite selection. Music listeners love this. But it also means more choices, probably <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/27/your-money/27shortcuts.html">too many choices</a>. In my search for music, I would go through the same one of these three directions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find song I want to hear, use iTunes Genius.</li>
<li>Select lots of songs I do not own using GrooveShark.</li>
<li>Choose artist I like, use Pandora.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these services are great. But each has its own drawback. Worst of all, none of them really lead to new music. Reading the blog endorsing the power of new music encouraged me to start my search. I wanted to find something that was not time consuming, had plenty of new music, and some old favorites mixed in. After trying a variety of sources, I finally found the goldmine.</p>
<h4>The Oldie-But-Goodie Sources</h4>
<p>My usual sources for music are great. But they make it hard to find new music.</p>
<h5>iTunes Genius</h5>
<p>The limits and benefits of Genius do not take long to figure out. Great for listening to genres of music you own. Not good for finding new music.</p>
<p>I love the iTunes Genius button. Since they came up with it I basically stopped making playlists. That combined with the time my music library got wiped out losing all my old playlists and ratings.</p>
<p>I use genius when I know what I want to listen to. Let's say I go with a classic like <em>Crosstown Traffic</em> by Jimi Hendrix. iTunes genius gives me a nice selection of rock mixed with some newer pop stuff. All songs I like, definitely a good playlist. But the problem-- I need to own all the music. So then I move on to GrooveShark.</p>
<h5>GrooveShark</h5>
<p>For people who do not know about GrooveShark, I encourage you to check it out now: <a href="http://grooveshark.com/">GrooveShark.com</a>. Two things about GrooveShark encourage me to use it over and over again.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create playlists from many many songs I do not own.</li>
<li>Find music from lists of popular songs.</li>
</ol>
<p>I mostly use this when I know what I want to listen to. Discovering new music on the poplar list is hit or miss. Otherwise you have to know which new music to search for, defeating the point.</p>
<p>GrooveShark also has a radio feature, but in my experience it does not compare to Pandora.</p>
<h5>Pandora</h5>
<p>Of course I have a <strong>Jimi Hendrix</strong> station of Pandora. And the station is great. But the music stays along the same lines as iTunes. I get some music that I do not own and perhaps a few new songs.</p>
<p>If I want to branch out I can start a station with a newer artist. Without a doubt, I have discovered great new music through Pandora. However the stations get stale regardless of where you start. A computer can only reach so far into new genres. I also find myself hitting skip until I find a comfortable song, defeating the whole point.</p>
<p>After creating about 30 Pandora stations I became frustrated and began my search.</p>
<h3>The Search for New Music</h3>
<p>The above three sources of music have provided most of my music the last two years or so. I rarely reach out to find new music. When I started, I realized I had no clue where to turn.</p>
<h4>Asking Friends</h4>
<p>None of my friends really seek out new music. Lots of people do, I just do not know them. If you know the right people this will probably be a great source.</p>
<p>For decades new music gained popularity through the radio, so I moved there.</p>
<h4>Streaming Radio</h4>
<p>I do not own a radio, limiting me to streaming radio. Luckily most radio stations stream now.</p>
<p>I love advertisements as much as the next person. So, I chose to stick with public radio streams only. My dad works in public radio so he had plenty of good suggestions for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>KEXP</li>
<li>The Current</li>
<li>WXPN</li>
<li>WBEZ</li>
<li>NPR Music</li>
<li>Lots more...</li>
</ul>
<p>Each station offers different types of music during the day. Without knowledge of what shows were closer to the kind of music I enjoyed I became frustrated. Plenty of stations also offer streaming of individual shows that I could match with my interests. That conflicts my goal of being time efficient though.</p>
<h4>Podcasts</h4>
<p>The jump from streaming radio to podcasts was easy. Lots of stations offer their shows as podcasts. But once again I ran into the problem of too many choices. Tons of music podcasts fill the iTunes directory.</p>
<p>Staring at the list of top music podcasts in iTunes is a strange experience. I started listening to some from the radio stations I enjoyed more. The experience was again hit or miss. Unfortunately, somewhere in the strange mix of podcasts in the top 10, I missed <em>NPR's All Songs Considered.</em></p>
<h3>The Goldmine</h3>
<h4>All Songs Considered</h4>
<p>After downloading and listening to some other podcasts, I returned to the top 10 disappointed and looking for more. Finally I found it, <strong><em>NPR's All Songs Considered</em></strong>: the perfect combination of new music and old favorites spiced up with great stories and music knowledge.</p>
<p>I am really happy with the podcast because not only do I get to hear new music, but the hosts have a vast understanding of the music. Unlike Pandora, the podcasts can jump from one genre to another while still having a common theme. And in the process of hearing music I am also learning about music-- the best of both worlds!</p>
<p>I have listened to about 30 of the 300 old episodes and am looking forwards to the rest. Best of all, there is a 24/7 music stream if I ever get tired of the commentary.</p> </div><!-- entry-content -->

                    <article class="content">
                        <div class="entry-content"> <p>I have been struggling to start. When I do start, I lack the patience to finish. This blog for example: I excitedly created the site, wrote the first post, and then waited, but nothing happened. For some reason the blog did not blossom like I had imagined.</p>
<p>Ben Franklin knew how to start his writing career. At thirteen, Franklin started by rewriting other's work. He never stopped. Shortly after he was submitting letters to the local paper under a fake name. Throughout his life he pushed new ideas forward. Ben Franklin initiated, just look at the list: successful printing shop, library, volunteer firehouses, safer fireplaces, bifocals, electricity. By poking the box, he became one of the most influential people of his era.</p>
<h4>Poke the box</h4>
<p>In his book, Seth Godin stresses starting and shipping - a blog post, a worldwide revolution, or helping a stranger unprompted - ship something new however large or small. The default, the safe thing to do is nothing. If you create enough then you will fail. Leading the reader by the hand and acknowledging all bad that may come, the book forces the reader take action. Without failing there cannot be success.</p>
<p>Throughout reading the idea of creative destruction was in my mind. Joseph Schumpeter proposed entrepreneurs drove the growth of the economy through creative destruction. Entrepreneurs are driven to markets where monopolies are coasting on old technological innovation. All of the new entrants attempt to create a more efficient technology. One successful innovation topples the old monopoly while creating a new one. The growth of the economy depends on the number and success rate of the entrepreneurs. With barriers to innovation at a low, this idea is more powerful than ever.</p>
<h3>Creative Destruction of the self</h3>
<p>Creative destruction has always described the economy, but what about a person? When I lift weights- that is creative destruction- I am destroying my muscle fibers to encourage them to grow back stronger. This is what Seth proposes.</p>
<h4>Create a new you: start</h4>
<p>This week I made the goal of doing getting 100% injury free. Using my awesome book, <em>The Complete Book of <strong>Pilates for Men</strong></em>, I planned my first mini-goal. I scoped out the <em>advanced reformer on the mat workout</em> and set it in my sights. About half the exercises looked impossible, but not quite.</p>
<h5>Start small</h5>
<p>I started with a simple 20 minute workout every morning, the <em>beginner mat workout</em>. A huge red X went on my calendar after each completed workout, the Jerry Seinfeld method. One week later I feel a bit stronger. But I really need to push the box.</p>
<h4>Deliver on that new you: ship</h4>
<p>Creating a plan and starting is good. The real goodness comes from shipping. In one month my calendar may be full of red- what then? Well, I will have a stronger core, maybe I will love Pilates or hate it. Cool, that does not sound so bad. In one year my calendar may be full of red- what then? My body will be stronger than ever. Even a third of the way through the book, my body moving in a way that was once impossible. Down the road, when I am 80, I may even be doing the stuff Joseph Pilates did.</p>
<h4>Failure or success is irrelevant if you progress</h4>
<p>In committing to do Pilates for thirty days I know I will push the box. So what if the Pilates space in my box never expands again. It has been pushed, it was not worth it, my box expanded and I moved to push elsewhere- maybe yoga. Then the process starts all over again. Always moving outwards.</p>
<p>I imagine myself testing to optimize my personal self. The goal of my life is to expand. Right now, I need to find where there are maximum returns, just as the entrepreneurs do in the creative destruction economy.</p>
<p>The markets where monopolies sit tantalize entrepreneurs. If they succeed in overthrowing the monopoly the rewards are great. They become the new monopoly. Markets where profits are small or levels of technology superior provide no motivation.</p>
<h5>Where is your personal monopoly?</h5>
<p>Part of you is stuck in routine. It refuses to change. You act the same way in certain situations, always acknowledge people in the same manner, or pick the same thing every time. Just once try act differently, see how it feels, let it soak in. Rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>In the economy one entrepreneur succeeds because so many others fail. If it was one entrepreneur vs one monopoly, I'd put my money on the monopoly. One million entrepreneurs and it is a different story. That is why the value comes from poking the box again and again not doing it once.</p>
<h3>Everyone poke together now</h3>
<p>It is scary to think about a world where every person is as determined as Ben Franklin was. Scary because of the amount of astonishing things that could be done. While each person has their own box to push, it is not all that gets pushed.</p>
<h4>One box growing encourages another</h4>
<p>One day someone in the neighborhood decides to push; she smile and says hello to everyone passing- a stranger smiles back. She watches his box expand as he walks away. A smile is one thing, but Ben Franklin reached for much more than just kindness towards strangers. At first he pushed to expand his own box, then that of the local paper, he did not stop until he made a huge dent in all of mankind.</p>
<p>With each small poke the boxes that enclose us grow; first the box of your house, then your neighborhood, and if you poke hard enough eventually you will push the box of all humanity further.</p> </div><!-- entry-content -->

                    <article class="content">
                        <div class="entry-content"> <p>I struggle to comprehend how our country has changed since its founding. Reading the autobiography of Ben Franklin I am struck by the amount of civility that abounds in the congress. People were actually pleasant enough to argue about an issue, compromise, then create a document that everyone liked. Has the character of our person's changed that dramatically.</p>
<p>This country lacks a solid moral compass. Our effects create the future yet we discard any ideas that take that into account. Everything is about the present. What helps me and now is not soon enough.</p>
<p>How can our youth understand this idea if the majority of adults refuse to accept the notion?</p>
<p>There is a moral struggle going on in our country. The right is scared of changes, progress, and new ideas. The left is afraid of shit I dunno- maybe how our country is spiraling down and down with every new law passed.</p>
<p>Our country was founded on compromise, new ideas, and a basic moral constitution. Where did those founding principles go.</p>
<p>Would we be able to recognize the benefit of a public hospital or library today. Could those institutions be created in this political climate? I doubt it. The public hospital first proposed required that the government match and private contributions. That would never happen in a million years. What changed?</p>
<p>Ben Franklin had an interesting line in his autobiography about people's unwillingness to change. He understood that accepting new ideas is difficult unless the situation forces it. How can we put ourselves in situations to force new ideas while remaining comfortable- or is that even possible. Perhaps it is the trickiness of situations that allow us to see situations in new light.</p>
<p>Franklin was a powerful man, yet he did not act is such a way. Franklin wanted everyone to accept an idea before it was put into practice. He was able to be convincing be trying to find what that person's individual interest or notion was. He then worked to tie that to the big picture.</p>
<p>Perhaps, we just lack that sort of big picture thinkers. Franklin was able to do a remarkable job of bringing everyone together without forcing one side to concede more than another. He wanted the largest benefit to the public in each situation.</p> </div><!-- entry-content -->
