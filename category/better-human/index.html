                    <article class="content">
                        <div class="entry-content"> <p>I began a new job with the Santa Fe Institute a few weeks ago. With a new job comes many changes. One change that I am very excited about is the chance to finally use a standing desk.</p>
<p>I have always been averse to spending all of my working hours sitting at a desk. I tried simple solutions like taking lots of breaks or using an exercise ball but that never solved the problem itself, sitting. Sitting caused my hip flexors and hamstrings to shorten which has been a continual source of pain and injury for me. I spent lots of time doing exercises to mitigate the effects but they always felt fruitless after spending eight hours a day sitting. The solution was staring at my face for ages, a standing desk.</p>
<p>I continued to read article after article of the benefits of a standing desk but I could never convince my employer to allow me a standing desk. Once I started at the Santa Fe Institute I asked during my orientation whether that was an option. I was lucky enough to procure the only standing desk in the facility. Even luckier for me, the desk is adjustable!</p>
<p>Similar to sitting, the ergonomic set up is important - perhaps even more so with standing. I am still working out the subtleties. I have the desk at the right height; the monitor may need some adjustment.</p>
<p>My biggest worry so far is my feet, especially with my achilles issue. The floor is carpeted. I wear my <a href="http://www.vivobarefoot.com/us/mens/gobi-black.html">vivo barefoot</a> shoes to work (highly recommended shoes) so there is minimal padding there, by design. I think the barefoot style shoes are important but I may have to invest in a more padded surface to stand on.</p>
<p>So now begins my standing desk experiment. I am monitoring my time standing/sitting using the <a href="http://www.standingclock.com/">standing clock</a>. I have also been taking daily measurements of my weight so I will use that as a quantitative measure of the effects along with my qualitative observations. I look forward for what is to come!</p> </div><!-- entry-content -->

                    <article class="content">
                        <div class="entry-content"> <p>Lately I have been honing in on my routines. This started with the idea of focusing on one habit each month. The first habit I developed was doing a daily morning walk. Since starting, I have habitually gone for a walk each and every morning. And I love it!</p>
<h3>Building Habits</h3>
<p>I have been struggling with my habit this month. I am trying to meditate every day, and I have failed more often than not. <a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2011/09/05/bookend-your-day-the-power-of-morning-and-evening-routines/">This post</a> on The Art of Manliness made me think about developing my morning and evening routines to build my habit each month.</p>
<h3>My Routines</h3>
<p>Thinking through my routines today, I created three lists:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideal Morning and Evening Routine</li>
<li>First Step Morning and Evening Routine</li>
<li>Current Morning and Evening Routine</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving backwards made me realize how far I have to go to reach my ideal routines! Right now my evening routine is nonexistent. So, I have some work to do.</p>
<h3>Baby Steps</h3>
<p>When building habits, taking small steps is the only way to success. I also created some <strong>rules</strong> for the morning and evening I have to stick by, regardless of where I am in my routine. This will help me address worries I had (feeling rushed meditating, looking at internet too long at night, etc.).</p>
<h4>Morning Routine</h4>
<p>My morning routine will look like this starting tomorrow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Walk</li>
<li>Write <a href="http://750words.com">750 words</a></li>
<li>Eat Real Food (Meat and Veggies) &amp; Clean Dishes</li>
<li><strong><em>Meditate</em></strong></li>
<li>Teeth Care (Floss/Brush)</li>
<li>Dress, Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only new thing here is meditation. I am also switching the order of eating and writing my 750 words. I have found it a bit hard to write after eating, I seem to get easily distracted by the internet during eating and that delay's my writing.</p>
<h5>Morning Rules:</h5>
<ol>
<li>No internet until 750 words are written.</li>
<li>Clean dishes before meditation.</li>
<li>Start meditation by 7:30am.</li>
<li>Determine topic for evening writing (during 750 words).</li>
</ol>
<p>My morning routine has been pretty stable over the last year. Whenever I add stuff in (morning walk), it seems pretty easy for me to get it done. I have a lot of willpower in the morning!</p>
<h4>Evening Routine</h4>
<p>On the other hand, I struggle with my evening routine. Between having a varied schedule for dinner, cooking, crossfit, or going out and not being sure what I want to do - I end up spending a lot of time just surfing the internet.</p>
<p>I hope by establishing a list of things I <strong>must</strong> do and times for when things to be done, I can do a better job of this. This list is going to be much shorter because I am just jumping into the whole evening routine thing. Baby steps!</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean up dishes after dinner</li>
<li><strong><em>Focused writing on a single topic</em></strong></li>
<li>Review goals, habits, day, life</li>
<li>Read</li>
</ul>
<p>The focused writing is something new. I always <em>intend</em> to write a blog at night, but find it hard to figure out the topic and then focus. That is where morning rule #3 comes in!</p>
<p>The other items in this list are things I have done with some regularity. But I hope to do them daily now (off and on...).</p>
<h5>Evening Rules:</h5>
<ol>
<li>No electronics after 8pm.</li>
<li>Start review by 8:30pm.</li>
<li>Clean all dishes, put away clothes, etc, before reviewing goals.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thats it! I have a ways to go to reach my ideal routine. For now, one step is enough.</p> </div><!-- entry-content -->

                        <h2 class="title"><a href="http://joeahand.com/archive/strengths/" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to Create Strength by Investing in Talent">Create Strength by Investing in Talent</a></h2></header>
                    <article class="content">
                        <div class="entry-content"> <p>The book Strength Finder 2.0 develops the idea of maximizing productivity through investment in talents. By understanding your talents you can create strengths while also being more engaged in your work. A greater awareness of my strengths will help me achieve more.</p>
<h3>The Strength Equation</h3>
<p>In the book, Strength Finder 2.0, Tom Rath introduces the three concepts of <strong>talent, investment,</strong> and <strong>strength</strong>. By <em>investing</em> in our <em>talents</em> we create <em>strengths</em>. He argues that spending time developing our weaknesses gives less return than developing our talents.</p>
<p>Our economy drastically underutilizes our skills because we fail to focus on our strengths. When you manager fails to focus on your strength you are likely to be disengaged at work. By investing in our weaknesses employers increase the chances that we will become bored and inefficient at work. Rather, Rath suggests we need to focus on our talents to become the best we can be.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You <strong>cannot</strong> be anything you want to be -- but you <strong>can</strong> be a lot more of who you already are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key is thinking in terms of talents and strengths, not knowledge and skills. By applying your talents to your interests you can build strengths, regardless of the area of study.</p>
<h4>Talent and Investment</h4>
<p>When we think of the word talent we often think of people who are exceptionally good at something-- Michael Jordan was a talented basketball player or Jimi Hendrix was a talented guitarist. Thinking about your own life, you may be a talented cook or writer. The book defines talent slightly differently from this common conception.</p>
<p>Instead of our common definition, consider talent "a natural way of thinking, feeling, or behaving." While this covers a great deal, I want to focus on the <strong><em>natural</em></strong> part of the definition.</p>
<p>People relate to and understand the world through different means. These ways to relate, or talents, are innate to who we are -- our natural talents. Rather than forcing everyone to conform to one way of thinking, by strengthening our natural abilities we can achieve more and be happier in the process.</p>
<p>This departure differs dramatically from the usual understanding of education. Education works on conforming everyone through the same methods to reach the same goals. By teaching everyone the same we are dramatically reducing the return on that education while boring people to death. Sounds like a lose-lose for everyone.</p>
<p>By investing in people in an individualized way, we create engaged students. Not only does this make the process of education more fun, but we get better results.</p>
<h4>Strengths</h4>
<p>Strengths require both talent and investment. Anybody can develop strengths in any venue of talent. But by focusing on our top talents we maximize the time we spend honing our skills.</p>
<p>Discovering our strengths also makes it easier for us to work with passion and actively engage in something. So without further ado... here are my results.</p>
<h2>My Strengths</h2>
<p>The online assessment takes about thirty minutes and is only available if you buy the book (great marketing). Along with your generic theme descriptions, they give a detailed summary of personal strengths. These are my top five strengths:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learner</li>
<li>Futuristic</li>
<li>Relator</li>
<li>Intellection</li>
<li>Responsibility</li>
</ul>
<p>The rest of the post I will be trying to understand more about myself, my strengths, and how I can apply them. None of them were super surprising. The relator I quested a bit until reading further into my personal summary, then it made sense. There are three sections of the report: <strong><em>awareness, application</em></strong>, and <strong><em>achievement</em></strong>. I will discuss each theme, then move on to the next section.</p>
<h3>Awareness</h3>
<h4>Learner</h4>
<p><strong><em>Generic Description:</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>People who are especially talented in the Learner theme have a great desire to learn and want to continuously improve. In particular, the process of learning, rather than the outcome, excites them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds just like me! I love learning. I am a sponge for all information from every source. I always loved school and have continued to learn since leaving school. The personalized description was more interesting.</p>
<h5>Personal Insights</h5>
<p>The whole thing is quite long, so no reason to post here. But I will pick out the things that I am most curious about.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You appear to study human beings the way others study for final tests. Your approach is direct. Your gaze is intense Your interest is sincere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is great! I am not sure about whether this is how I really approach others. I am usually a pretty shy person, naturally quite introverted. The description talks a lot unusual individuals capture my attention and I become curious about them. I will need to work on developing this part of my learning talents.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chances are good that you will your mind with new ideas by asking questions, reading, studying, observing or listening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ummmm. Talk about generic statements. How else could one fill their mind?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because of your strengths, you yearn to know a lot. It makes little sense to you to skim through a book and read only the highlights. You delve more deeply into intriguing subjects than most people do. You love to gather all kinds of information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Definitely true. One look at my bookshelves reveal this. I have a broad range of topics that have struck my interest. I usually read enough about the topics until I feel like I have a solid understanding of the issues then move on. Usually I start with the more important and influential books on the subject and move toward a fringe or two that really peaks my learning curiosity.</p>
<p>For learner, I need to work on developing my ability to learn from other people the most. The report also mentions my ability to give counsel to others. Something that I enjoy doing, but do not actually get the chance to much right now. So, reaching out more and developing those relationships may help me build that strength.</p>
<h4>Futuristic</h4>
<p><strong><em>Generic Description:</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>People who are especially talented in the Futuristic theme are inspired by the future and what could be. They inspire others with their visions of the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Always thinking about the future, but I need to work on inspiring others with my visions.</p>
<h5>Personal Insights</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>Because of your strengths, you invest considerable time creating the future of your own choosing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am hoping to create my own future as we speak. The most important thing I want to do is invest in my strengths.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Driven by your talents, you feel enthusiastic about life when you contemplate everything you can accomplish in the coming months, years, or decades. You probably need to know what the future holds before you can concentrate on today's activities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very true. Sometimes it gets to the point where I get little done if I do not know how this helps the future. This can definitely make it difficult to get some things done. But...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You think in terms of possibilities. This allows you to recover from setbacks, problems, disappointments, or even disasters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The upside of looking to the future. There are speed bumps, but they are nothing compared to the long term.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's very likely that you sense your life has deep meaning. With remarkable vividness, you often imagine where you will be, what you will be doing, and what you have the ability to accomplish in the coming months, years, or decades. Your dreams of tomorrow are very alive in your mind today... The question you must answer is this: "How far into the future can I think before my ideas start becoming vague or uninspiring?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Definitely the part of futuristic that I struggle with. I need to balance having a long term vision with the ability to motivate myself to get there. I often abandon projects or areas of study when I get frustrated with the short term and lack the overall vision.</p>
<h4>Relator</h4>
<p><strong><em>Generic Description:</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>People who are especially talented in the Relator theme enjoy close relationships with others. They find deep satisfaction in working hard with friends to achieve a goal.</p>

                    <article class="content">
                        <div class="entry-content"> <h3>Intro to Pilates</h3>
<p>Joseph Pilates founded pilates to help bed ridden patients begin injury recoveries. Bed ridden or not, I have my share of injuries and imbalances. By focusing on moving from your powerhouse, Pilates helps teach your body proper alignment and movement using your core muscles- a powerful idea.</p>
<p>I first tried Pilates when my mom gifted me with a private session with her teacher. Walking into a Pilates studio is intimidating. There are a myriad of strange machines with straps and springs. There are all sorts of balls and oddly shaped equipment.</p>
<p>My first lesson was an awakening. I had never felt that sense of control while feeling so out of control.</p>
<h4>Using your powerhouse</h4>
<p>If you had a powerhouse why would you not use it? Well, good news, you do! The powerhouse idea in Pilates establishes the base of every movement. Imagine a rectangle going from your pelvic floor to your shoulders enclosing everything in between. That is your powerhouse. Deep inside your core you have hugely strong and expansive muscles that pull everything from your pelvis, spine, and organs together. Pilates teaches you to initiate each movement with that base and then engage the isolated muscles.</p>
<p>Moving from the powerhouse is a powerful idea. By requiring that movement start and end in the center of the body- Pilates teaches you to move with utmost control, focus, and breath.</p>
<h3>Pilates for Men, the book</h3>
<p>After some major injuries I came back to Pilates with the hope of becoming injury free. I failed then and that is why I return once again.</p>
<p>The goal this time is much more substantial and focused. My overriding goal is to become injury free- and stay that way. After looking through the book I understood that by making it to the end I would achieve that goal. So I set up a fake goal. I want to become an advanced Pilates and Yoga dude. In the process I hope to rid myself of injuries and gain a new sense of bodily balance.</p>
<h3>Dunking</h3>
<p>In the end, I really want to dunk.</p>
<p>The basketball rim sits at 10 feet high. The ball either goes in or it doesn't There is some fantasy aspect about dunking. The image of flying high to pack it down is unyielding. Always a little bit higher. You either get there, or you fail.</p> </div><!-- entry-content -->
