Title: Finding New Music
Category: uncategorized
Kind: article

###Enjoying the Music

I listen to music a lot. While I am not a huge music buff, I like to have stuff playing while I work, cook, clean, or just hang around my house.

Music becoming digital has led to a near infinite selection. Music listeners love this. But it also means more choices, probably [too many choices](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/27/your-money/27shortcuts.html). In my search for music, I would go through the same one of these three directions:

* Find song I want to hear, use iTunes Genius.
* Select lots of songs I do not own using GrooveShark.
* Choose artist I like, use Pandora.

All of these services are great. But each has its own drawback. Worst of all, none of them really lead to new music. Reading the blog endorsing the power of new music encouraged me to start my search. I wanted to find something that was not time consuming, had plenty of new music, and some old favorites mixed in. After trying a variety of sources, I finally found the goldmine.

#### The Oldie-But-Goodie Sources

My usual sources for music are great. But they make it hard to find new music.

##### iTunes Genius

The limits and benefits of Genius do not take long to figure out. Great for listening to genres of music you own. Not good for finding new music.

I love the iTunes Genius button. Since they came up with it I basically stopped making playlists. That combined with the time my music library got wiped out losing all my old playlists and ratings.

I use genius when I know what I want to listen to. Let's say I go with a classic like *Crosstown Traffic* by Jimi Hendrix. iTunes genius gives me a nice selection of rock mixed with some newer pop stuff. All songs I like, definitely a good playlist. But the problem-- I need to own all the music. So then I move on to GrooveShark.

##### GrooveShark

For people who do not know about GrooveShark, I encourage you to check it out now: [GrooveShark.com](http://grooveshark.com/). Two things about GrooveShark encourage me to use it over and over again.

1. Create playlists from many many songs I do not own.
2. Find music from lists of popular songs.

I mostly use this when I know what I want to listen to. Discovering new music on the poplar list is hit or miss. Otherwise you have to know which new music to search for, defeating the point.

GrooveShark also has a radio feature, but in my experience it does not compare to Pandora.

##### Pandora

Of course I have a **Jimi Hendrix** station of Pandora. And the station is great. But the music stays along the same lines as iTunes. I get some music that I do not own and perhaps a few new songs.

If I want to branch out I can start a station with a newer artist. Without a doubt, I have discovered great new music through Pandora. However the stations get stale regardless of where you start. A computer can only reach so far into new genres. I also find myself hitting skip until I find a comfortable song, defeating the whole point.

After creating about 30 Pandora stations I became frustrated and began my search.

### The Search for New Music

The above three sources of music have provided most of my music the last two years or so. I rarely reach out to find new music. When I started, I realized I had no clue where to turn.

#### Asking Friends

None of my friends really seek out new music. Lots of people do, I just do not know them. If you know the right people this will probably be a great source.

For decades new music gained popularity through the radio, so I moved there.

#### Streaming Radio

I do not own a radio, limiting me to streaming radio. Luckily most radio stations stream now.

I love advertisements as much as the next person. So, I chose to stick with public radio streams only. My dad works in public radio so he had plenty of good suggestions for me:

* KEXP
* The Current
* WXPN
* WBEZ
* NPR Music
* Lots more...

Each station offers different types of music during the day. Without knowledge of what shows were closer to the kind of music I enjoyed I became frustrated. Plenty of stations also offer streaming of individual shows that I could match with my interests. That conflicts my goal of being time efficient though.

#### Podcasts

The jump from streaming radio to podcasts was easy. Lots of stations offer their shows as podcasts. But once again I ran into the problem of too many choices. Tons of music podcasts fill the iTunes directory.

Staring at the list of top music podcasts in iTunes is a strange experience. I started listening to some from the radio stations I enjoyed more. The experience was again hit or miss. Unfortunately, somewhere in the strange mix of podcasts in the top 10, I missed *NPR's All Songs Considered.*

### The Goldmine

#### All Songs Considered

After downloading and listening to some other podcasts, I returned to the top 10 disappointed and looking for more. Finally I found it, ***NPR's All Songs Considered***: the perfect combination of new music and old favorites spiced up with great stories and music knowledge.

I am really happy with the podcast because not only do I get to hear new music, but the hosts have a vast understanding of the music. Unlike Pandora, the podcasts can jump from one genre to another while still having a common theme. And in the process of hearing music I am also learning about music-- the best of both worlds!

I have listened to about 30 of the 300 old episodes and am looking forwards to the rest. Best of all, there is a 24/7 music stream if I ever get tired of the commentary.
