Title: Yummy Chocolate Chip Cookies
Category: 

Ever since I can remember I made Chocolate Chip Cookies. Ten years ago I discovered a recipe I really liked, memorized it, and spent the next ten years experimenting on slight variations. I always get lots of people asking me for my recipe, so here it is.

***The real secret is not what you put in the cookies, but how you make them. So be sure to add lots of love!***

### Chocolate Chip Cookies

Follow the directions, make yummy cookies, and share them with your friends.

#### Ingredients (double or triple as necessary):
 * 2 Cups Flour
 * 1/2 tsp Sea Salt
 * 1/2 tsp Baking Soda
 * 1 c Brown Sugar
 * 1/2 c White Sugar
 * 3/4 c Butter
 * 1 egg
 * 1 egg yolk
 * 1 tbsp vanilla

#### Directions
1. Start by getting all of your ingredients out in one place. That way you will not forget anything. Put things away after each step and make cleaning so much easier!
2. Mix dry stuff in bowl, set aside.
 * 2 Cups Flour
 * 1/2 tsp Sea Salt
 * 1/2 tsp Baking Soda
3. Mix sugars and butter in new bowl. Melted butter is easier but changes how dough bakes (__See Note__).
 * 1 c Brown Sugar
 * 1/2 c White Sugar
 * 3/4 c Butter
4. Mix in eggs and vanilla.
 * 1 egg
 * 1 egg yolk
 * 1 tbsp vanilla
5. Add dry stuff into wet about 1/2 cup at a time and mix with a gentle force.
6. Add chocolate chips (about 1 cup but really a personal preference here).
7. Place on cookie sheet. Make whatever size you want. Bake at 325 for 12ish minutes, until edges are browned.

___Note:___ The dough (and therefore cookies) is much better if put in the fridge for 24-48hrs wrapped in plastic/tightly covered, especially if you melt the butter. Melted butter makes the dough little tough to work with immediately. Take it out of the fridge 30min before you plan on baking the cookies.

Good luck and enjoy the cookies.
