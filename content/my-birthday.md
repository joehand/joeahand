Title: It's my birthday!
Category: note
Kind: note

Today marks a quarter century since I was born. It also marks the first day of summer, though this year was one of the rare years the my birthday and the solstice did not coincide.

I joined some friends for a beautiful picnic last night in Portland's Rose Garden. Great friends, great food, nice weather, flowers, and some good wine. Not much more you need for a good birthday celebration.

I have thought a lot about living a long life. I hope this quarter century marks the first of six in my life. 150 seems like a long life. But I will be sure to enjoy every day of it.

Happy first day of summer!

=)

Also - just for the record - biking home with a bunch of balloons tied to your back is pretty fun. I would recommend it.
