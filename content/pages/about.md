Title: About Joe

Hi there! Glad you made it. Want to get in touch? Send me a message: joe @ this website.

* I am interested in the overlap of social systems, math/technology/data, and urban environments.
* I hope to help communities (especially in cities of the Global South) solve local problems with technology & data.
* I think we can do a better job of creating global/open/free resources to help solve those problems (e.g. Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap).
* I enjoy playing with data (census, quantified self, basketball).
* I'd like to be better at Python, and am working on it.

Things I've done (*somewhat*) recently:

* Worked at [Santa Fe Institute](http://santafe.edu/) to bring census-like data collection tools to slum dwellers worldwide, gather worldwide census data, and conduct research to understand cities (project in partnership with [Slum/Shack Dwellers International](http://www.sdinet.org/), funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation).
* Managed projects at [Periscopic](http://www.periscopic.com/), a data visualization company with the aim to "do good with data", for clients including Unicef, Yahoo!, GE, the Economic Policy Institute, and the Hewlett Foundation.
* Attended [Reed College](http://reed.edu/) where I also wrote a thesis on creative destruction ([PDF Link](https://cdn.joeahand.com/Hand_ReedSeniorThesis_2009.pdf) - sorry!), and conducted research on [peer learning effects](http://www.reed.edu/teagle_grant/index.html).

I also spend my time reading ([books](https://www.goodreads.com/joehand) and [articles]({filename}/pages/reading.md)), biking, cooking, [writing Python](https://github.com/joehand), swinging kettlebells, playing ultimate Frisbee, being human, and walking outside. Oh and sleeping.

For a more organized and in depth history of Joe, please see my [CV]({filename}/pages/cv.md). If you really want to know the earliest details, my first job was as a bike repair apprentice and I graduated high school in 2005.

# About This Website<a name="about-site"></a>

This site runs on the [Python](https://www.python.org/)-Powered [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com) static site generator. Read about how I built the website [in this post]({filename}/dynamic-static-pelican.md).
You can explore the code [on GitHub](https://github.com/joehand/joeahand).
It is served on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), via [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) ([with easy & free SSL](https://sheharyar.me/blog/free-ssl-for-github-pages-with-custom-domains/)).

**Homepage**:
The homepage data is stored in Google Docs (via [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com)) and visualized with Python ([my Pelican gdocs plugin](https://github.com/joehand/joeahand/tree/master/plugins/pelican_gdocs) and [similar tutorial](http://jlord.us/blog/your-own-instagram.html) for JS version).
Data is processed on my shiny [Digital Ocean server](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=94657bdeab0c).
I use a [cron job](http://crontab.org/) to get new data and regenerate the site daily (at the strike of midnight).

**Charts**:
Coffee chart is made using a `<table>`, CSS, and lots of Joe.
Daily steps chart is made with the [Chartist.js](http://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/index.html) library.

**Design**:
I designed the site with a lot of inspiration from others.
Thank you others.
The fonts are [EB Garamond](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/EB+Garamond) and [Open Sans](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans), served using [base64 encoding](http://bdadam.com/blog/better-webfont-loading-with-localstorage-and-woff2.html).
I used [Pure CSS](http://purecss.io/layouts/) as my css foundation.

*It is amazing how many people did great work so I could build a website. Pretty cool.*
