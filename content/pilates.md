###Intro to Pilates

Joseph Pilates founded pilates to help bed ridden patients begin injury recoveries. Bed ridden or not, I have my share of injuries and imbalances. By focusing on moving from your powerhouse, Pilates helps teach your body proper alignment and movement using your core muscles- a powerful idea.

I first tried Pilates when my mom gifted me with a private session with her teacher. Walking into a Pilates studio is intimidating. There are a myriad of strange machines with straps and springs. There are all sorts of balls and oddly shaped equipment.

My first lesson was an awakening. I had never felt that sense of control while feeling so out of control.

####Using your powerhouse

If you had a powerhouse why would you not use it? Well, good news, you do! The powerhouse idea in Pilates establishes the base of every movement. Imagine a rectangle going from your pelvic floor to your shoulders enclosing everything in between. That is your powerhouse. Deep inside your core you have hugely strong and expansive muscles that pull everything from your pelvis, spine, and organs together. Pilates teaches you to initiate each movement with that base and then engage the isolated muscles.

Moving from the powerhouse is a powerful idea. By requiring that movement start and end in the center of the body- Pilates teaches you to move with utmost control, focus, and breath.

###Pilates for Men, the book

After some major injuries I came back to Pilates with the hope of becoming injury free. I failed then and that is why I return once again.

The goal this time is much more substantial and focused. My overriding goal is to become injury free- and stay that way. After looking through the book I understood that by making it to the end I would achieve that goal. So I set up a fake goal. I want to become an advanced Pilates and Yoga dude. In the process I hope to rid myself of injuries and gain a new sense of bodily balance.

###Dunking

In the end, I really want to dunk.

The basketball rim sits at 10 feet high. The ball either goes in or it doesn't There is some fantasy aspect about dunking. The image of flying high to pack it down is unyielding. Always a little bit higher. You either get there, or you fail.
