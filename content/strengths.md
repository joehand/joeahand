Title: Create Strength by Investing in Talent
Category: better human
Kind: article

The book Strength Finder 2.0 develops the idea of maximizing productivity through investment in talents. By understanding your talents you can create strengths while also being more engaged in your work. A greater awareness of my strengths will help me achieve more.

###The Strength Equation

In the book, Strength Finder 2.0, Tom Rath introduces the three concepts of **talent, investment,** and **strength**. By *investing* in our *talents* we create *strengths*. He argues that spending time developing our weaknesses gives less return than developing our talents.

Our economy drastically underutilizes our skills because we fail to focus on our strengths. When you manager fails to focus on your strength you are likely to be disengaged at work. By investing in our weaknesses employers increase the chances that we will become bored and inefficient at work. Rather, Rath suggests we need to focus on our talents to become the best we can be.

> You **cannot** be anything you want to be -- but you **can** be a lot more of who you already are.

The key is thinking in terms of talents and strengths, not knowledge and skills. By applying your talents to your interests you can build strengths, regardless of the area of study.

####Talent and Investment

When we think of the word talent we often think of people who are exceptionally good at something-- Michael Jordan was a talented basketball player or Jimi Hendrix was a talented guitarist. Thinking about your own life, you may be a talented cook or writer. The book defines talent slightly differently from this common conception.

Instead of our common definition, consider talent "a natural way of thinking, feeling, or behaving." While this covers a great deal, I want to focus on the ***natural*** part of the definition.

People relate to and understand the world through different means. These ways to relate, or talents, are innate to who we are -- our natural talents. Rather than forcing everyone to conform to one way of thinking, by strengthening our natural abilities we can achieve more and be happier in the process.

This departure differs dramatically from the usual understanding of education. Education works on conforming everyone through the same methods to reach the same goals. By teaching everyone the same we are dramatically reducing the return on that education while boring people to death. Sounds like a lose-lose for everyone.

By investing in people in an individualized way, we create engaged students. Not only does this make the process of education more fun, but we get better results.

####Strengths

Strengths require both talent and investment. Anybody can develop strengths in any venue of talent. But by focusing on our top talents we maximize the time we spend honing our skills.

Discovering our strengths also makes it easier for us to work with passion and actively engage in something. So without further ado... here are my results.

##My Strengths

The online assessment takes about thirty minutes and is only available if you buy the book (great marketing). Along with your generic theme descriptions, they give a detailed summary of personal strengths. These are my top five strengths:

* Learner
* Futuristic
* Relator
* Intellection
* Responsibility

The rest of the post I will be trying to understand more about myself, my strengths, and how I can apply them. None of them were super surprising. The relator I quested a bit until reading further into my personal summary, then it made sense. There are three sections of the report: ***awareness, application***, and ***achievement***. I will discuss each theme, then move on to the next section.

###Awareness

####Learner

***Generic Description:***

>People who are especially talented in the Learner theme have a great desire to learn and want to continuously improve. In particular, the process of learning, rather than the outcome, excites them.

Sounds just like me! I love learning. I am a sponge for all information from every source. I always loved school and have continued to learn since leaving school. The personalized description was more interesting.

#####Personal Insights

The whole thing is quite long, so no reason to post here. But I will pick out the things that I am most curious about.

>You appear to study human beings the way others study for final tests. Your approach is direct. Your gaze is intense Your interest is sincere.

This is great! I am not sure about whether this is how I really approach others. I am usually a pretty shy person, naturally quite introverted. The description talks a lot unusual individuals capture my attention and I become curious about them. I will need to work on developing this part of my learning talents.

>Chances are good that you will your mind with new ideas by asking questions, reading, studying, observing or listening.

Ummmm. Talk about generic statements. How else could one fill their mind?

>Because of your strengths, you yearn to know a lot. It makes little sense to you to skim through a book and read only the highlights. You delve more deeply into intriguing subjects than most people do. You love to gather all kinds of information.

Definitely true. One look at my bookshelves reveal this. I have a broad range of topics that have struck my interest. I usually read enough about the topics until I feel like I have a solid understanding of the issues then move on. Usually I start with the more important and influential books on the subject and move toward a fringe or two that really peaks my learning curiosity.

For learner, I need to work on developing my ability to learn from other people the most. The report also mentions my ability to give counsel to others. Something that I enjoy doing, but do not actually get the chance to much right now. So, reaching out more and developing those relationships may help me build that strength.

####Futuristic

***Generic Description:***

>People who are especially talented in the Futuristic theme are inspired by the future and what could be. They inspire others with their visions of the future.

Always thinking about the future, but I need to work on inspiring others with my visions.

#####Personal Insights

>Because of your strengths, you invest considerable time creating the future of your own choosing.

I am hoping to create my own future as we speak. The most important thing I want to do is invest in my strengths.

>Driven by your talents, you feel enthusiastic about life when you contemplate everything you can accomplish in the coming months, years, or decades. You probably need to know what the future holds before you can concentrate on today's activities.

Very true. Sometimes it gets to the point where I get little done if I do not know how this helps the future. This can definitely make it difficult to get some things done. But...

>You think in terms of possibilities. This allows you to recover from setbacks, problems, disappointments, or even disasters.

The upside of looking to the future. There are speed bumps, but they are nothing compared to the long term.

>It's very likely that you sense your life has deep meaning. With remarkable vividness, you often imagine where you will be, what you will be doing, and what you have the ability to accomplish in the coming months, years, or decades. Your dreams of tomorrow are very alive in your mind today... The question you must answer is this: "How far into the future can I think before my ideas start becoming vague or uninspiring?"

Definitely the part of futuristic that I struggle with. I need to balance having a long term vision with the ability to motivate myself to get there. I often abandon projects or areas of study when I get frustrated with the short term and lack the overall vision.

####Relator

***Generic Description:***

>People who are especially talented in the Relator theme enjoy close relationships with others. They find deep satisfaction in working hard with friends to achieve a goal.
